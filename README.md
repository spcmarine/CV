## Dan Gibson

Having started my career in social work management, I built critical skills in leadership, problem solving, communication and risk management. Since then, my motivations have pivoted to tech where I can apply these skills and also fulfil my passion for software. I have always been interested about how things work and the scope for innovation in software development. Technology is central to each of our lives, and I have been keen to apply my skills and knowledge in a new sector. 

I am eager to leverage my transferable skills in communication, empathy, and project management to build innovative software products that positively impact lives.

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

- Gained experience of api requests.
- Independent learning and problem-solving throughout

#### Kingston University (2006 - 2009)

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

I have a love of the outdoors and where possible I like to spend time in the mountains either riding my mountain bike or snowboard. 

Additionally, I have a passionate interest in motorsport. I spent several years actively participating in car racing. Notably, during my university years, I had the honour of being elected president of the karting society on two occasions. This role involved competing at a national level, proudly representing our university.
