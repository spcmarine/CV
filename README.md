I am an aspiring software Having started my career in social work management, I built critical skills in leadership, problem solving, communication and risk management. Since then, my motivations have pivoted to tech where I can apply these skills and also fulfil my passion for software. I have always been interested about how things work and the scope for innovation in software development. Technology is central to each of our lives, and I have been keen to apply my skills and knowledge in a new sector. 

I am eager to leverage my transferable skills in communication, empathy, and project management to build innovative software products that positively impact lives.

## Skills

#### Communication
Effective communication has been central to my journey to date. As a social worker and manager, I regularly interacted with diverse teams, clients, and stakeholders, requiring me to convey complex information in a clear and empathetic manner. This experience honed my ability to adapt my communication style to suit different audiences and situations. 

Furthermore, my time at Makers bootcamp emphasised the importance of precise and concise communication within a technical context. Collaborative coding projects demanded effective team communication to ensure seamless integration of individual contributions.

I find great satisfaction in fostering an open and inclusive environment where ideas and concerns are freely exchanged. Whether it's a team meeting, a client consultation, or a collaborative coding session, I strive to ensure that everyone feels heard and understood.

#### Team Work
Throughout my career, I've consistently demonstrated strong teamwork and leadership capabilities. As a Social Work Team Manager, I led diverse teams of social workers, operating at both operational and strategic levels. This experience instilled in me the importance of effective collaboration and communication in achieving common goals. I played a pivotal role in overseeing complex projects and worked closely with local and central government departments, showcasing my ability to coordinate efforts and build productive relationships across various stakeholders. During my time at Makers there has been a strong emphasis on pair programming and group projects. My experiences of team work has really aided my transition into tech, particualrly when it has come to quicly integrating into a team and establishing shared goals and understanding. 

#### Problem Solving

In my roles within social work, I encountered multifaceted challenges on a daily basis. These situations required not only immediate attention but also careful consideration of the underlying issues and potential long-term solutions. Situations would often be both complicated and complex, with a high level of risk assocaited with them. Problem solving became an inherent part of my daily practice, thinking critically, analysing situations and considering them from multiple perspectives. 

Transitioning into the tech industry, I've carried this problem-solving mindset with me, applying it to coding challenges and projects. The structured problem-solving approach I developed in social work has translated into the world of software development, enabling me to approach coding tasks with a systematic and analytical mindset.

#### Orgnaisational skills

My previous career required a high degree of organisation and meticulous attention to detail. Managing high caseloads, coordinating resources, and ensuring compliance with policy and law. Additionally, I led on developing and implementing streamlined processes, enhancing team productivity and optimising service delivery. I have experience in writing reports for court, giving evidence and instructing legal teams, each of which require a high level of organisation. 

I understand the importance of well-organized and readable code. My experience through completing Makers projects has given me an appreciation of version control and the importance of creating robust and scalable software solutions.

## Hobbies

I have a love of the outdoors and where possible I like to spend time in the mountains either riding my mountain bike or snowboard. 

Additionally, I have a passionate interest in motorsport. I spent several years actively participating in car racing. Notably, during my university years, I had the honour of being elected president of the karting society on two occasions. This role involved competing at a national level, proudly representing our university.
